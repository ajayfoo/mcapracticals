### AWTL(Advanced Web Technologies)
#### [Practical No.1](https://github.com/ajayfoo/mcapracticals/tree/master/2SEM/AWTL/1Practical):
Design UI based applications using basic Windows forms Controls
1. WAP in C# that ask the user to enter a month, a day and a two digit year. The
program should then determine whether the month times a day is equal to the year.
If so, it should display the message saying the date is magic. Otherwise not a magic
2. WAP to perform Money Conversion.
3. WAP To convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius or vice versa
4. Create a Window application to calculate age of a person by providing input as birth
date and current date .Current date and Birth date must be in long string format and
display the age in terms of years.
#### [Practical No.2](https://github.com/ajayfoo/mcapracticals/tree/master/2SEM/AWTL/2Practical):
Design Applications using Classes and Objects.
1. Write a program to declare a class “staff” having data members as name and post.
Accept this data 5 staffs and display names of staff who are HOD.
2. Define a class “salary” which will contain member variable Basic, TA, DA, HRA. Write
a program using Constructor with default values for DA and HRA and calculate the
salary of the employee.
